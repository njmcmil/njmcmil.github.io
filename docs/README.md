## About Me
Hello, I'm Nathan McMillan.

I'm a junior at Clemson University, pursuing a degree in Computer Science. 
I have a passion for developing innovative software solutions, and I enjoy tackling complex challenges in programming and design.

In my academic journey, I've gained strong foundations in languages like C, C++, and Java. 
 Beyond coding, I’m deeply interested in building applications that solve real-world problems and creating systems that inspire.

When I’m not immersed in my coursework, I love exploring the intersection of technology and creativity, 
whether it's through personal projects or other collaborative projects.
