## About Me
Hello, I'm Nathan McMillan.

I'm a junior at Clemson University, pursuing a degree in Computer Science. 
I have a passion for developing innovative software solutions, and I enjoy tackling complex challenges in programming and design.

In my academic journey, I've gained strong foundations in various programming languages. But beyond coding, Iâ€™m deeply interested in building applications that solve real-world problems and also creating something that leaves an impact on the user.
